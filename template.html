	Notes: 
	
	This program scales with the window, so it is able
	to be played on any size screen, 100 inches diagonal,
	or down to your cell phone screen size. 
    
	I tested it on both my 43 inch TV HDMI cabled an Asus Rog String (Windows 10 Home) laptop,
	and my S21 Ultra Samsung 6.8 inch sreen, running Android 11 OS, 6 GB System RAM, 256 BG SSD.
	It uses viewport height, or viewport width for a way to size things in relation to screen.
	(vh = viewport height, vw = viewport width).
	Normally, people would use pixels, em, % or something else.
    like margin: 10px; this program says margin: 1vh;
	By using vh & vw, it scales with the browser, from 25% to 500% it all looks the same.
	The only downside of this is you cannot scale the window to zoom in or out.



	Dependencies:       		(Shown in load order.)
	Filenames:					Descriptions:

	template.html				The main HTML5 document (this file.)
	
	css/normalize.css			The Cascading Style Sheet (browsers all behave the same, found on github.com).
    
    The Specific Cascading Style Sheet allows the user to choose light or dark themes, possibly.
    Just write 2 different css text files with only the color theme different.
    This file tells the browser color, size, page behavior and event handlers.

	The head element has meta data the browser needs to properly display your page.
    Links external Cascading Style Sheets & JavaScript programming code.
    The head element lets a browser look at the cotents of the head, 
    from its opening element tag, to its closing elements tag.
    
    The <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags are all mandatory.
    
    Most all elements in an html document, have a tag called the opening and closing tag of the element.
    p is the tag for a paragraph. 
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    The html language do not care about blank spaces or indentation.
    That is so a programmer can read it.
    
    The reserved word div is an element used 
    
    
	The <title>element</title> is mandatory per w3schools.com.
